# Refactoring The ATM

This project is a ATM app used to both deposit and recieve money. The user can enter their desired amount, click submit, and see their total account balance. For my improvements, I focused on the CSS aspect as what stuck out to me most as a viewer was the lack of style. I changed and added different fonts, colors, and sizing. With the functionality running smoothly, CSS stlying was my next step!
